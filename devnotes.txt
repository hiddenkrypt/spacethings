	<span class="account_title">Your Privacy Matters</span>
	<p id="privacyText">
		<u>Passwords:</u>
		<br> Your password is not stored on the server. Passwords are encrypted with SHA-1 hashing
		in your browser before being sent to the server. 
		This means your password is changed into a code through a one-way process. It is designed to be
		very difficult to turn the code back into the original password (estimates suggest years of 
		computing time). SHA-1 is a moderately secure hashing function.  This code is salted and hashed 
		again on the server side (currently using the more secure bcrypt 
		algorithm) before being stored in the database. This process is extremely reliable for keeping your
		password secret from everyone but you. I cannot see your password, nor can I determine it from 
		the codes that get sent from your computer. All this is to help prevent someone (including 
		myself) from taking your password and trying it on other sites to see if you reused it. 
		A man-in-the-middle attacker can easily hijack your account with a replay attack. I'm okay with 
		that, as this is just a silly web game. A successful attack can access your account, but these
		protections mean they will <i>not</i> see your password. 
		<br>I recommend strongly that you do <i>not</i> reuse passwords on multiple sites. However, 
		recommendations don't stop people, so I've taken every reasonable precaution to limit harm.
		<br><i>There is no automated password reset system.</i> If you can't remember your password, 
		you'll have to contact me directly so I can manually fix the problem. 
	</p>
	<p id="privacyText">
		<u>Game Message System:</u>
		<br> 
		All in game communications are plain text and stored as such. This means anybody with access to 
		the server may read them. 'In-game' they can be considered as private as your counterespionage  
		efforts can make them, but in real life they aren't very private. Please never put account details, 
		credit information, or other sensitive things into in game communications. 
	</p>
	<p id="privacyText">
		<u>Contact Info:</u>
		<br> Your contact info will be requested as a part of this game, but will not be on this server 
		at all unless you put it there (i.e. putting your email address in an in-game message). I will 
		request contact info of players, and if you wish to keep it secure, you may send your info to me 
		via other services such as email, plurk, or steam chat. I will store contact info locally on my 
		home machine.
		<br><i>I will not give your contact info to anybody. Ever.</i> I won't use it for evil in any way.
	</p>
	<p id="privacyText">
		<u>Server:</u>
		<br>Euclid ( aka euclid.nmu.edu or cs.nmu.edu ) is the Northern Michigan Computer Science 
		and Mathematics Department webserver. It is administrated by Dr. Randy Appleton, Professor of 
		Computer Science. It is used by dozens of students for various projects. As such, security is...
		interesting. All of those students can see the database info I put in there. Passwords
		are secured by multiple levels of cryptographic hashing. As detailed above, your password is hashed and 
		encoded before it ever leaves your computer, and encrypted again before being stored.. All other information is essentially public for
		those with server access. Also, while Randy does a wonderful job keeping the server going, 
		there are outages, usually caused by sophomore programmers accidentally the whole computer. 
		That's all out of my hands.
